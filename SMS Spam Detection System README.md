# SMS Spam Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based system for detecting spam messages in SMS data. The model classifies messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

The SMS Spam Detection System analyzes text messages and identifies whether they are spam or legitimate. Using machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression, this project helps in filtering unwanted messages efficiently.

## Features

- Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham.
- Uses text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Can be extended with deep learning models for improved performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language.
- scikit-learn: For building and training the model.
- pandas & numpy: For data manipulation.
- nltk: For text preprocessing.
- matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
- Google Colab: For interactive development.

## Data

The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It includes two columns:
- `label`: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).
- `message`: The actual text of the SMS.

### Source

The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for spam classification tasks.

## Modeling

The machine learning models used for spam detection include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and tokenizing text.
   - Removing stopwords and special characters.
   - Converting text into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.

2. **Training**  
   - Using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest classifiers.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Results

### Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~95% (varies with model selection and dataset)
- Precision & Recall: Balanced for optimal spam detection

### Interpretation

- High accuracy ensures effective spam filtering.
- Precision and recall values indicate a good trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

## How to Run the Project
